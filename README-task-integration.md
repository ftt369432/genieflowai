# Notebook Task Integration System

This document outlines the integration between notebooks and task management in our application.

## Overview

The Notebook Task Integration feature allows users to:

1. Convert any notebook text block into an actionable task
2. Track task progress and completion within notebooks
3. Use AI to intelligently extract tasks from notebook content
4. Manage task properties like status, priority, due dates, and assignees
5. Visualize task completion progress for each notebook

## Components

### 1. TaskBlock Component
The core component that displays task information and allows users to:
- Update task status and priority
- Set due dates and assignees
- Convert blocks to tasks
- View tasks in the main task management system

### 2. NotebookTaskIntegration Component
Provides a dashboard view of all tasks within a notebook, including:
- Task progress metrics
- Task distribution by status
- Tools to generate tasks from notebook content
- Display of all notebook tasks in one view

### 3. Task Types
The system defines comprehensive task types in `src/types/tasks.ts`:
- Task status (todo, in-progress, blocked, completed)
- Task priority (low, medium, high)
- Task source tracking (to link tasks back to notebooks)
- Task metadata (assignees, due dates, tags)

## User Flow

1. **Create Tasks from Notebook Content**
   - Users can manually convert any text block to a task
   - AI can automatically identify action items and convert them to tasks
   - Tasks maintain their context within the notebook structure

2. **Manage Tasks**
   - Update task status, priority, and other properties directly from the notebook
   - Visual indicators show task status and progress
   - Track overall notebook task completion

3. **Task Integration**
   - Tasks created in notebooks appear in the main task management system
   - Changes sync bidirectionally between notebooks and the task system
   - Notebook context is preserved when viewing tasks in the task system

## Technical Implementation

The integration is built using:
- React components with TypeScript for type safety
- Custom UI elements (DatePicker, TaskBlock) for a consistent user experience
- State management for tracking task changes
- AI integration for task identification and generation

## AI-Powered Features

1. **Task Extraction**
   - Intelligently identifies action items in notebook text
   - Understands contextual clues like "TODO", "action item", or task-like phrases
   - Extracts detailed task information including potential deadlines and priorities

2. **Task Organization**
   - Suggests related tasks based on notebook content
   - Can categorize tasks by type or priority
   - Provides insights on task dependencies

## Future Enhancements

1. **Calendar Integration**
   - Connect tasks with deadlines to calendar events
   - Schedule focused work time for specific tasks
   - View task deadlines in calendar context

2. **Project Templates**
   - Create pre-defined task structures for common projects
   - Allow templating of notebooks with task sections
   - Enable quick project setup with task hierarchies

3. **Collaboration Features**
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Track team progress on notebook-based projects
   - Share task-enhanced notebooks with collaborators

## Getting Started

To use the task integration features:
1. Open a notebook from the Notebooks page
2. Select the "Tasks" tab in the notebook view
3. Click "Generate Tasks from Content" to automatically extract tasks, or
4. Add task blocks manually to sections
5. Manage tasks directly within the notebook interface
