        Having completed our review, we now issue our Opinion and Decision After Reconsideration.
        
        Applicant claims injury to his back on January 1, 2020, while working as a warehouse worker for 
        defendant. The issue presented is whether the injury arose out of and in the course of employment.
        
        The workers' compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) found that applicant's injury did arise 
        out of and in the course of employment. The WCJ awarded applicant temporary disability benefits, 
        medical treatment, and attorney's fees.
        
        Defendant contends that applicant's injury occurred while he was on a lunch break and had left 
        the employer's premises, and thus did not arise out of and in the course of employment.
